# ShortenUrl
URL Shorten Project
The URL shortener operates by receiving an original URL through a POST request, checking it against a blacklist to ensure it doesn't propagate harmful content. If cleared, the URL is transformed using the MD5 hashing algorithm. The shortened URL and its original counterpart are stored in a PostgreSQL database. A GET request with the shortened URL fetches the original URL from the database and redirects the user. The project leverages Google Cloud Run for its serverless infrastructure, providing scalability and ease of deployment.
